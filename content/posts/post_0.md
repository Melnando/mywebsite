Iâ€™m Melchior Thierry, a final-year student at ESILV (Paris-La DÃ©fense), specializing in Cybersecurity, IT & IoT.

This website allows me to share my academic background, technical projects, research, and personal thoughts on cybersecurity.

**Why this website?**

More than just a rÃ©sumÃ©, I wanted to create a personal space thatâ€™s more flexible than LinkedIn to:

- Provide in-depth details about my projects, especially those related to research or hackathons  
- Share technical articles (CTF write-ups, tools, feedback, etc.)  
- Centralize useful links: rÃ©sumÃ©, Root-Me profile, publications, and more

**A consciously *low-tech* approach**

Aligned with my awareness of digital sustainability, I chose to build a lightweight, static, and fast-loading site, with minimal dependenciesâ€”designed to be resource-efficient for both visitors and the hosting server.

**Whatâ€™s next?**

Iâ€™ll be publishing:
- Write-ups of challenges (Root-Me, hackathons, etc.)  
- Simplified summaries of my research work  
- Technical analyses (OS hardening, NIDS, cryptography, etc.)
